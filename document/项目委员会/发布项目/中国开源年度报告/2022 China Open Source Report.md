# 2022 China Open Source Report

# Preface



As 2022 finally came to an end, we also emerged from the challenging years of the three\-year\-long COVID pandemic\. The new edition of the \&\#34;China Open Source Annual Report\&\#34; for the coming year is once again presented to all our friends\. We are now at the stage where everything is ready, only waiting for the \&\#34;Preface\&\#34; to be written\. Looking back at the prefaces of the past years\&\#39; reports, reading through the upcoming report\&\#39;s content, and reflecting on this year\&\#39;s significant events and personal journeys, what can we discuss about the \&\#34;annual report\&\#34;?



### About \&\#34;Dramatic Change\&\#34;

In the 2020 report, I wrote: \&\#34;Perhaps many years from now, when we look back at 2020, we will call it: the beginning of a dramatic change in the world\.\&\#34; in the 2021 report, I also wrote, \&\#34;The world is changing dramatically, and we are living in a world that is rushing in some unknown direction\.” What changes can we expect to see in the year 2022? What trends can we observe in dramatic changes that do not show signs? What guesses can we make about the unknown orientation?

One interesting phenomenon is that technology, software, and open source are driving change in the world while the world is changing them\. **Open source is moving into the next phase of development**\. The era of open\-source heroism is nearing dusk, and open\-source led by large enterprises and foundations is becoming a reality\. Readers can see the end of the story in this Annual Report for the year\.

### About \&\#34;Creation\&\#34;

What will happen to open source in such a process?

The production of agricultural society is not about waiting for \(helping\) plants and animals to grow\. The production of industrial society has become very large, delicate, and complex, but after all, it is still visible and tangible\. In the digital world, creation, innovation, collaboration, and win\-win situations need to be redefined in the grid consisting of 0 and 1\. Costs, profits, and market share will also need to be recalculated\. This is still a trend that has emerged in recent 20 years\.

In 2022, ChatGPT emerged, AIGC is ascending, and AI has been used in various production processes\. **Production needs to be redefined again\!**

What will happen to open source in such a process?

### About \&\#34;Responsibility\&\#34;

Another significant event in 2022 is the worldwide chain reaction caused by the Russian\-Ukrainian war, which cannot be avoided even in the open\-source community\. In a recent discussion with a friend, I expressed the opinion that: \&\#34;We need to understand the real open source world to **reason about how to face the real open source world**?\&\#34;, \&\#34;Any exaggerated bunker insurance that listens to the bunker in the rain, or ignores the bunker insurance in a cover\-up manner, is irresponsible\.\&\#34;

As responsible open source people, we must do our best to know and understand the real open source world and do everything we can to push it for the better, or at least keep it from sliding into the worse\. With this in mind, let us usher into a new year\!

# Open Source Milestones

## Overview

Starting in 2021, we introduced the \&\#34;Open Source Highlights\&\#34; section in our annual report\. The initial idea was relatively simple: with so many significant events happening in the open source world every year, we can select and organize them and provide some commentary, which would be sufficient\. However, by the time we reached 2022, things had become more challenging\.

Firstly, there was the issue of categorization\. With so many events, how should we classify them? Some events seemed to fall under both community and business categories while also relating to open\-source security\. How should we handle such cases?

Secondly, there was the challenge of selection\. What indeed constitutes a significant event? With numerous investments being made in the open source space every year, how significant should an investment be to warrant attention? Should we prioritize global impact or focus more on the impact within China?

Lastly, there was the task of summarization\. When viewing these ongoing stories from a historical perspective, which trends are worth paying attention to? And which may just be temporary sensations?

In the following content, we have divided the year\&\#39;s major events into five categories: \&\#34;Open Source Business,\&\#34; \&\#34;Open Source Security,\&\#34; \&\#34;Open Source Technology,\&\#34; \&\#34;Open Source Legal,\&\#34; and \&\#34;Open Source Community \&amp; Ecosystem\.\&\#34; This division is our attempt to provide an annual summary\.



## Open Source Business Conference

### Investment Cooling Down in China\&\#39;s open source Business Sector

In 2022, the heavy uncertainty in the international metal market and the sluggish economy in the post\-epidemic era also affected the open\-source business sector\. After two years of continuous \&\#34;open source investment boom\&\#34; in 2020\-2021, this year, we felt investment and financing in the open source business sector gradually cool down\.

According to incomplete statistics, in 2022, 13 open\-source business companies in China obtained financing, and the number of deals is only 1/2 of 2021\. Except for Zilliz, which received USD 60 million in Series B\+ financing \(also in the early to mid\-stage stage\), all other investments are in Series A or early pre\-Series A, and the transaction amount is even more dramatic than in 2020\-2021\. After talking with many investors and entrepreneurs who are interested in open source Infra, we found that after \&\#34;cooling down,\&\#34; the investors will return to the essence of saying that \&\#34;open source is manual but not intended\&\#34; and paying more attention to the feasibility and implementation path from open source community to commercialization\.

**Experts’ Comments**

Wei Jianfan: \&\#34;Using love to generate electricity\&\#34; certainly cannot convince investors\. Right?

### \&\#34;Big Corporations\&\#34; Establish Open Source Management Offices, Emphasizing Open Source Compliance and Security

Although the \&\#34;open source investment boom\&\#34; has faded, the past two years have accelerated using open source technologies in thousands of industries with capital support\. This has also revealed several security and compliance concerns\.

Log4j vulnerability in late 2021 reached nearly half of the world\&\#39;s technology companies and took the security of open\-source projects to a new high level\. At the same time, the Software Freedom Consortium sued Vizio for violating the GPL, the Oracle v\. Google copyright infringement case got settled, and the related case law became the focus of discussion, which also has excellent reference significance for the future open source compliance governance of enterprises\. More and more companies focus on open\-source specifications and flow processes\.

Along with the increasing application of open\-source technology, enterprises are paying attention to the awareness of open\-source compliance and the standardization process\. Many enterprises in China have started to explore the possibility of establishing an open\-source program office \(OSPO\) and coordinating enterprises\&\#39; internal and external open\-source work by establishing a mature methodology\.

- **Internally**: OSPO participates in open source strategy decisions, formulates interconnected systems and processes for introducing open source software and provides technical and legal guidance, ensures that open source use and contribution comply with the license specification, promotes the construction of internal open source files, and open source talent training, formulates and manages performance and incentive measures of internal open source work, manages internal open source IT infrastructure, promotes internal source community building and internal tool development, etc\. The team also manages the internal open\-source IT infrastructure and promotes the construction of the internal source community and internal tool development\.

- **Externally**: OSPO connects internal open source teams and external communities, maintains good collaborative relationships with upstream communities, open source metallic societies, and other communities, actively guides internal technical teams to participate in external community contributions, and develops corporate open source technology promotion strategies at the group level\.

<div class="callout">

**Experts’ Comments**

Bian Silang: I quite like the expression \&\#34;diplomat\.\&\#34; In the words of the book Silicon Valley, OSPOs are also \&\#34;deal makers\&\#34; who pull in many factors that make a community/company successful, making some chemistry happen that would otherwise be impossible and making others happen more efficiently\.

</div>

- In May 2022, ByteDance published an internal email to announce the establishment of the open source Committee\. Before this, open\-source committees/open\-source program offices were set up at Alibaba, Huawei, ZTE, Tencent, Ant Group, Drip, WeBank, Millet, Baidu, etc\.

- In February 2022, TODO Group and Linux Foundation Research collaborated to publish the \&\#34;Evolution of the open source Project Office\&\#34; white paper; in March 2022, the KAIYUANSHE ONES Group was established, focusing on enterprise open source strategy research; in September 2022, the first domestic \&\#34;OSCAR open source Industry Conference\&\#34; was launched at the China ICT Academy\. 2022 OSPO Case Study Compendium \(Issue 1\)\&\#34; was officially released, featuring OSPO practice cases from many enterprises; in October 2022, the OSPO Summit launched by Linux Foundation APAC Evangelist Team OSPO SIG was Officially announced\.

Around open source compliance and open source security, as the investment and financing market continues to cool down, Sectrend has received two angels and Pre\-A rounds of investment of tens of millions of dollars against the trend but also proves that the enterprise open source code scanning and compliance governance has become an immediate need\.

**Expert Review**

**Guo Xue****: **The open source office in China will take many different forms, including open source committees, open source groups, and virtual or physical organizations\. The future development of the Open Source Office in the enterprise may follow the development path of the Standard Office, which is responsible for internal and external collaboration, pulling together various business teams, and setting unified rules\. The growth of the open source Office also reaffirms that open source is moving up the corporate strategy ladder\.

**Bian Sikang****: **Many kinds of open source offices \(OSPOs\) exist, and specific implementations are worth exploring and discussing in the industry\. The value of an open\-source office is reflected in the following:

1. OSPO is a standardized API that can significantly reduce the cost of collaboration in the open\-source space;

2. OSPO is a \&\#34;service\&\#34; that takes responsibility for issues and challenges that were previously in the gray zone, starting with risk, moving to efficiency, and delivering business results with a lot of room for improvement;

3. When OSPO is linked, it will become an \&\#34;open source value grid,\&\#34; which is the \&\#34;OSPO community\.\&\#34;

**Wang Wei****: **Compared to TODO Group, which was set up in 2012, the establishment of ONES Group represents that the attention and practice of OSPO in China has just begun\. The rapid growth of open source in China has given us new opportunities to synchronize with the world and practice innovation\. This year\&\#39;s report, we have begun to see open source innovation projects such as OpenDigger \(the open source community of Trangeland\), DevLake \(Apache\), Hypercrx \(East China Normal University\), and other open source projects led by domestic enterprises, universities, and government agencies, begin to play an increasingly important role in the power of open source committed to data services\. I believe OSPO China Landscape\&\#39;s first version can be successfully released this year\. Wait and see\.

**Yang Liyun****: **Both ONES GROUP and OSPO are new open\-source governance models\. In the past two years, the concept has been gradually recognized and adopted as open\-source applications have gradually entered the eyes of domestic open\-source communities and enterprises\. To do an excellent job of open source governance, scientific and reasonable tools are vital parts that can provide decision support for decision\-makers objectively and scientifically\. I hope that in incubating the OpenDigger project and combining it with ONES GROUP\&\#39;s platform, we can play a more critical technical support role in the future\.

### Going Global: Chinese Open Source Companies Collectively Expand Overseas

Regarding the most frequently mentioned keyword among Chinese software companies in 2022, it is \&\#34;going abroad\.\&\#34; From meetups in various communities to cross\-industry conferences to conferences for users and developers in various software companies, we have seen lively discussions about \&\#34;going abroad\&\#34; at many community events, and the broader international market has become a common choice for Chinese open\-source commercial companies\. PingCAP, Zilliz, JinaAI, TAOS Data, API7, StreamNative, SphereEx, StarRocks, and other well\-known open\-source commercial companies have started to set up or have a particular scale of sales, community operation, and research teams overseas, with the CXO himself in charge\.

We have seen that among many software companies going abroad, open\-source commercial companies are faster and more likely to gain greater attention in the international market\. This is because software product development is often \&\#34;fast\.\&\#34; Open source helps products get quick feedback from users\. It attracts \&\#34;people from the same field\&\#34; to contribute to the community so that their experience in the production environment can accelerate product development, improve product quality, and feed the community of developers and ISV partners\. At the same time, open source means openness, which is more conducive to building trust with potential overseas customers\. Potential customers can see every piece of code of the product and learn about the product development plan and community input through the open governance of the community\. In addition, open source itself is also a customer acquisition tool\. Compared to the traditional software\&\#39;s lengthy payment decision process, open\-source products can let the target customers quickly get started\.

Gartner forecasts that the global SaaS market will reach $176\.6 billion by 2022\. We look forward to seeing more leading technology companies take their research results in their areas of expertise to the global stage\.

<div class="callout">

**Expert Review**

**Bian Sikang**: In this context, \&\#34;quick feedback from users\&\#34; is a success factor, but it does not mean immediate software product development is good\. More often than not, the best way to build a product is to reach out to the community and customers, listen to their feedback, and think carefully about the logic of the product itself\. In other words, the AIGC may be \&\#34;fast and furious\&\#34; now, but in the SCA field mentioned above, what is needed is calm and steady thinking, as well as a corresponding strategic determination\.

## Open Source Security Big Issues

Security by 2022 is a community\-wide consensus, and today, open\-source software is the backbone of critical infrastructure\. 80% of the code used in enterprise applications comes from open\-source software, and 95% of open\-source vulnerabilities exist in transferable dependencies\. open source security has become a big arena that will be increasingly valued by enterprises in the future\.

### Rising Trend of Open Source Security Attacks, Network Data Breaches Become Major Concern

Network security has become a top priority for enterprises, with as many as 62 percent of respondents having experienced a security incident that impacted their business in the past two years\. The frequent network attacks have caused severe impacts and losses to the victim enterprises and their business infrastructure systems\.

An unknown attacker used stolen third\-party OAuth tokens maintained by Heroku and Travis CI to download data from the private repositories of dozens of companies, resulting in the theft of 100,000 npm USB accounts\.

The Spring4Shell vulnerability has entered an outbreak, and according to CheckPoint\&\#39;s telemetry data, approximately one\-sixth of the organizations affected by the Spring4Shell zero\-day vulnerability worldwide have been targeted by attackers\. According to a security advisory issued by Spring, the Spring4Shell vulnerability affects Spring MVC and Spring WebFlux applications on JDK 9, and the vulnerability requires that the application be deployed as a WAR running on Tomcat\. The Spring4Shell vulnerability has been compared to the Log4j vulnerability\.

### Frequent Occurrence of CVE Vulnerabilities in Core Software, Wide\-ranging Impact, and Extensive Reach

Polkit is a component that controls system\-wide permissions in a Unix\-like operating system, enabling communication between processes of different priority by defining and reviewing permissions rules\. Polkit is present in the default configuration of all major Linux distributions, and attackers can exploit this vulnerability by modifying environment variables to elevate local user privileges\.

Redis is an open\-source database written in ANSI C, supports a network, and can be memory\-based or persistent, with a Key\-Value store\. A code injection vulnerability exists in Redis, which attackers can exploit to construct malicious data to perform a sandbox escape attack without authorization and eventually obtain the highest privileges on the server\.

### Open Source Security Organization Releases Open Source Software Security Guidelines, Several Alliances, and Companies Release Vulnerability Reward Metals Program

In 2022, the OpenSSF \(open source Security Foundation\) released four consecutive guidelines on open source software security, including \&\#34;A Short Guide to Evaluating open source Software,\&\#34; \&\#34;A Short Guide to Developing More Secure Software,\&\#34; \&\#34;A Guide to Collaborative Vulnerability Disclosure \(CVD\) for Security Researchers and open source Software Projects,\&\#34; \&\#34;NPM Best Practices Guide,\&\#34; and other open source lifecycle security guidelines that provide best practices for open source software use, development, vulnerability reporting, package management, and more\. They provide security best practices for open\-source software usage, development, vulnerability reporting, and package management\.

The EU offers a VRD program for five major open\-source projects, including LibreOﬃce, the open\-source file editing application\. The network\-based implementation for hosting the private social network Mastodon, the enterprise ERP application Odoo, the application for exchanging encrypted information Cryptopad, and the software to help draft legislation LEOS\. Google has launched a new vulnerability rewards program for security researchers who find and report vulnerabilities from Google\&\#39;s open\-source projects\.

### Open Source Security Tools and Open Source Security Projects Successively Launched

In 2022, Google entered the vulnerability management market by announcing OSV\-Scanner, a free vulnerability scanner that provides developers access to open\-source project vulnerability information\. Google claims that OSV\-Scanner offers the largest community\-editable open\-source vulnerability database available\. OSV\-Scanner enables developers to automatically match code and dependencies to a list of known vulnerabilities and determine if patches or updates are available\. In addition, to strengthen the security of the software supply chain, Google launched the GUAC open\-source project, which will address the need to create rapidly evolving work across the ecosystem to create software build, security, and dependency metadata\.

GitHub is also planning to make a free scanning tool called secret scanning available to all public repositories to help developers avoid leaking login credentials via program code\. In the meantime, Github has added five more categories of users, requiring mandatory two\-factor authentication \(2FA\) by the end of March 2023\.

### Grid Security Market Forecast to 2023

In the context of the digital economy, network security has become a necessity for the digital industry\. It accelerates its penetration into traditional industries as the global digital transformation deepens\. The global market size of the network security industry continues to grow and is expected to increase to $169\.156 billion in 2022\. Due to the negative global macroeconomic impact, the expected growth rate of the global network security market in 2022 is expected to drop to the lowest point since 2020\. However, it maintains a growth level higher than 7%\.

Global Cybersecurity Market Size \(Million dollars\)

A number of Gartner\&\#39;s top analysts share their top grid security predictions for 2023\. These include: supply chain and geopolitical risks will dominate network security, secure grid architecture will simplify security, zero trust will play a key role in risk management, DevSecOps will become business critical, automated security operations will increase detection capabilities, data\-centric approach to network security, endpoints and workloads will require adaptive protection, and human\-operated ransomware will become a more significant threat\.

## Open Source Technology Conference

As we look back on 2022, the world continues to struggle with epidemics, wars, and local instability\. However, open source technologies continue to grow rapidly in all directions thanks to the increasing importance of open source in the industry\.

Adopting open source technologies, whether in enterprise or the community, is influenced by the urgency of technology needs and the degree of technology flow\. According to many official statistics, we can see that in the past year, the most popular fields are human intelligence \&amp; machine learning \&amp; deep learning, followed by operating systems, cloud computing, and databases, which are also supported by open\-source and have gained much attention and open source contributions\.

According to the 2022 State of open source Report, a survey published by OpenLogic and the open source organization OSI, 77% of respondents have expanded their use of OSS in the past year, with 36% indicating a significant increase in use\. The information collected shows the adoption of open\-source technologies by companies and developers:



In the same period, Red Hat published \&\#34;The State of Enterprise open source: A Red Hat report,\&\#34; in which it conducted in\-depth interviews with more than 1,200 technology leaders around the world and found that technology leaders have been active in promoting the adoption and contribution of open source technologies, especially in technologies such as artificial intelligence \(AI\) or machine learning \(ML\), edge computing or Internet of Things \(IoT\), containers, and wireless computing\. The report found that technology leaders have been active in driving the adoption and contribution of open\-source technologies, especially in technologies such as artificial intelligence \(AI\) or machine learning \(ML\), edge computing or Internet of Things \(IoT\), containers, and serverless computing, and have been very careful and practical in driving the adoption of open source technologies\.

Therefore, we have focused on developing open\-source technologies in the following essential technology tracks over the past year\. We have evaluated several events that have significantly impacted the open\-source field\. We will review their progress and discuss their significance\.

### Artificial Intelligence

## open source Legal Conference

### SFC v\. Vizio: The First GPL Enforcement Lawsuit Initiated by Consumers

Software Freedom Conservancy \(SFC\), in October 2021, filed a lawsuit against television manufacturer Vizio, alleging that Vizio failed to comply with the GPL open source software license terms in providing streaming products and services, particularly its SmartCast system\. SFC demanded that Vizio adhere to the corresponding licensing requirements\. Vizio, on the other hand, requested the court to dismiss SFC\&\#39;s breach of contract claims, arguing that they should be subject to the jurisdiction of the U\.S\. federal copyright law, excluding the application of state contract law\. However, the U\.S\. District Court for the Central District of California rejected this request in May 2022, stating that the GPL is a copyright license and a contractual agreement, granting SFC the right to bring this lawsuit\. This means that SFC can continue with the breach of contract claims at the state level\. If successful, all software users of Vizio\&\#39;s SmartCast system would have the right to enforce their rights as beneficiaries of the GPL license\. The uniqueness of this case lies in the fact that SFC is not suing as a copyright holder but as a consumer, asserting that Vizio failed to comply with the open source software license agreement requirements, thereby depriving downstream software users of the rights guaranteed by the license\. Based on the license terms, downstream software users have a reasonable expectation that Vizio would make the relevant source code available for review, modification, and distribution\. This is the first actual consumer\-initiated GPL enforcement case in the open source community\.

<div class="callout">

**Expert Review**

**Liang Yao**: The distinctive feature of this case is that the plaintiff is a consumer/user, while the determination of the contractual nature of the GPL has already been established in prior precedents\. In recent years, there have been more instances in China where smartphone consumers questioned certain companies for not publicly disclosing relevant code in accordance with the adopted open source software licenses\. Still, there have been no related cases, and China lacks a rights protection organization similar to SFC\. The \&\#34;SFC v\. Vizio\&\#34; case may provide some valuable insights and references in this regard\.

</div>

### GitHub Copilot: Copyright Controversy Arises from AI Training with open source Code

GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programming tool powered by OpenAI Codex\. It is primarily positioned to provide code completion and suggestion\. It is a plug\-in for Visual Studio Code that automatically creates code based on the content of the current file and the current cursor position\. Copyright issues are one of the main challenges, which is considered to be the use of open source code for training AI and outputting related code without following the open source license, such as not indicating the source, author, and license of the related code\.

Programmer and lawyer Matthew Butterick and several other lawyers filed a class\-action lawsuit against Copilot\. The Software Freedom Conservancy \(SFC\) calls for a protest against using GitHub\. Former CEO of GitHub, Nat Friedman, mentions that \&\#34;training on publicly available data falls under fair use\.\&\#34; However, there is currently a lack of relevant legal precedents regarding \&\#34;fair use\&\#34; in AI training in the United States\.

In addition, Microsoft describes the Copilot output as a series of code \&\#34;suggestions\&\#34; and emphasizes that it does not \&\#34;claim any rights\&\#34; to these suggestions\. Also, Microsoft does not warranty the resulting code\&\#39;s accuracy, security, or extended intellectual property rights\. Nat Friedman has claimed that the output of Copilot is attributable to the operator in the same way as using a compiler\. So as long as the advice of Copilot is accepted, then the user himself is liable for it\. However, you cannot obtain the code\&\#39;s source, authorship, and license when you accept Copilot\&\#39;s recommendations and risk infringement\.

### Nanjing Future v\. Jiangsu Yunqingting: First Case in China Where Court Supports GPL Defense

In October 2022, the first judgment in China was issued, supporting the defendant\&\#39;s GPL defense\. The plaintiff, Nanjing Future High\-Tech Co\., Ltd\., filed a lawsuit against Jiangsu Yunqingting Information Technology Co\., Ltd\., and Mr\. Liu for copyright infringement of computer software\. The plaintiff sought joint compensation from the two defendants for economic losses totaling 20 million yuan\. The defendant\&\#39;s lawyers discovered that the plaintiff\&\#39;s code contained software licensed under \&\#34;GPL \+ Exception\.\&\#34; After analyzing the code, they argued that the plaintiff\&\#39;s software did not meet the requirements of the exception in the license and did not disclose the source code, constituting a violation of the GPL\.

The court held that the main program of the software in question was a derivative work of the GPL open source code and was bound by the GPL agreement\. The \&\#34;Exception Statement\&\#34; did not apply to it\. The plaintiff violated the GPL\&\#39;s requirement to provide a corresponding source code, constituting a breach of contract\. The license obtained by the plaintiff under the GPL was terminated\. If the court were to protect the plaintiff\&\#39;s actions as a copyright infringement by other parties, it would grant the plaintiff a special legal status and special commercial interests based on its improper conduct, which would be inconsistent with fairness and sound faith principles\. Granting legal protection to the plaintiff\&\#39;s violation of the GPL agreement would undermine the provisions of the GPL regarding the continued openness of source code and have a detrimental effect on the dissemination of source code through the GPL agreement\.

Regarding the main program of the plaintiff\&\#39;s software in question, the court did not accept the plaintiff\&\#39;s claim that the two defendants constituted copyright infringement\. The court also did not support the plaintiff\&\#39;s request for the defendants to bear corresponding liability for copyright infringement\. The preview program was not a derivative work of the GPL open source code and was not contaminated by the GPL open source code\. Therefore, it was not bound by the GPL agreement\. The protection of the copyright of this portion of the software claimed by the plaintiff and the determination of whether the defendants infringed upon it were not affected by the GPL agreement\.

<div class="callout">

**Expert Review**

**Wei Jianfan**: Software companies using open source software must pay extra attention, especially to find out which open source software is used, what copyright requirements are imposed on this open source software, study the specific terms of the relevant open source licenses, and ensure their compliance with the law\. Otherwise, it is easy to fall into the trap of violating copyright without knowing it\.

### China Information and Communication Research Institute \(CIOT\) Takes the Lead in Establishing the \&\#34;Trusted Open Source Compliance Program\&\#34; and Releases the \&\#34;Open Source Compliance Guidelines \(Enterprise Edition\)\&\#34;

At the \&\#34;OSCAR Open Source Pioneer Day\&\#34; held on May 20, 2022, the China Information Technology Institute \(CITI\) took the lead in establishing the \&\#34;Trusted Open Source Compliance Program\.\&\#34; It released the \&\#34;Open Source Compliance Guidelines \(Enterprise Edition\)\.\&\#34; The \&\#34;Trusted Open Source Compliance Program\&\#34; is a domestic open source organization focused on compliance\. It was jointly established by CITI, enterprise users, research institutions, and legal experts in China\. Its goal is to mobilize various parties, gather many domestic talents in open source compliance, integrate high\-quality resources, improve the open source compliance standard system, share experiences in open source compliance, and comprehensively enhance China\&\#39;s level of open source compliance\. There are 53 founding member organizations, including 22 formal and 31 associate members\.

The \&\#34;Open Source Compliance Guidelines \(Enterprise Edition\)\&\#34; were jointly compiled by experts from member organizations of the \&\#34;Trusted Open Source Compliance Program\&\#34; under the leadership of the China Information Technology Institute \(CITI\)\. This publication analyzes and summarizes the development characteristics of open source compliance, explicitly focusing on research areas such as compliance risks related to open source software and data, provisions of open source licenses, and risk prevention and control for enterprise open source compliance\. It provides strong guidance for enterprises to comply with open source regulations effectively and is a valuable reference for promoting open source compliance construction in China\.

### China Electronics Technology Standardization Research Institute Leads the Completion of the Mulan OpenWorks Licenses and Open Governance Standards

At the \&\#34;2022 Mulan Summit\&\#34; held on December 29, 2022, the Mulan OpenWorks Licenses \(Mulan OWLs\), a series of legally binding format contracts that regulate and constrain the copying, use, modification, and distribution of open works, were officially released\. The Mulan OWLs, led by the China Electronics Technology Standardization Institute \(CETSI\), provide categories of license agreements granting patent licenses and specify attribution requirements for derivative works\. Alongside the license agreements, the Mulan OpenWorks Center was also launched as an application platform for the Mulan License Family, providing support for the registration, retrieval, and usage of Mulan open source software, data, and open works\. The release of the Mulan OpenWorks Licenses series and the application platform is of great significance in protecting the rights of creators and promoting the development of open works\.

In addition to the aforementioned \&\#34;Open Source Compliance Guidelines \(Enterprise Edition\),\&\#34; the Intellectual Property Protection Department of the National Intellectual Property Administration \(NIPA\) also addressed open source\-related topics such as \&\#34;intellectual property risks associated with the use of open source software\&\#34; and \&\#34;whether the use of open source software in product development is free\&\#34; in its \&\#34;Guidelines for Enterprise Intellectual Property Protection\&\#34; published in April 2022\.

Furthermore, during the Mulan Summit on December 29, 2022, the CETSI announced that the development of its \&\#34;Open Source Governance Standards\&\#34; is nearing completion\. This includes the overall framework, enterprise governance assessment model, project assessment model, community governance and operations, and developer contribution evaluation model\. After multiple rounds of discussions and consensus, these five standards will be officially promulgated in 2023, marking the implementation of authoritative, systematic, and normative work in open source governance in China\.

The \&\#34;Research Report on the Synergistic Development of Open Source and Standards\&\#34; was jointly researched and compiled by relevant experts in China\. It systematically analyzes and elucidates the relationship between open source and standards based on practices and achievements in domestic and international open source projects, communities, and standard research\. It clarifies the connotation and extension of open source under new development trends, providing ideas, directions, and recommendations for further promoting the systematic development of open source standardization in China\.

<div class="callout">

**Expert Review**

**Liang Yao**: In addition to the aforementioned \&\#34;Open Source Compliance Guidelines \(Enterprise Edition\),\&\#34; the Intellectual Property Protection Department of the National Intellectual Property Administration \(NIPA\) also addressed specific topics related to open source in its \&\#34;Guidelines for Enterprise Intellectual Property Protection\&\#34; published in April 2022\. The guidelines included dedicated sections on \&\#34;intellectual property risks associated with the use of open source software\&\#34; and \&\#34;whether the use of open source software in product development is free\.\&\#34;

**Wang Wei**: Several members of the KAIYUANSHE are directly involved in the preparation and development of the open source governance series of standards of the China Institute of Electrotechnical Standardization, reflecting both the growing recognition of the KAIYUANSHE as a think tank and the exploration of this new model of government\-community cooperation in China, where open source is reshaping the traditional world of operation\.

**Yang Liyun**: open source licenses and standards are integral to establishing rules and methodologies for open source practices\. They contribute to developing open source in our country and internationally through rigorous and meticulous research efforts\. As a new member of the Mulan OpenWorks Licenses \(Mulan OWLs\), the Mulan open source license family has recently been actively engaging and exchanging with the Open Source Initiative \(OSI\), promoting the internationalization of open works licenses\. The standards of open source governance need to be applied to the practical governance processes of Open Source Program Offices \(OSPOs\), integrated with open source tools like OpenDigger, and used in coordination, to unleash the synergistic effect of \&\#34;1\+1 \&gt; 2\&\#34;\.

## Open Source Community and Ecosystem Milestones

### Politics is Everywhere, Open Source Cannot Stand Alone

February 24, 2022, marked the beginning of the Russian\-Ukrainian War, as Russia launched a sudden military invasion of Ukraine\. In the world of open source, several significant events unfolded, demonstrating that open source, seemingly removed from politics, is not immune to external influences\.

Several well\-known open source communities and projects have expressed support for Ukraine on GitHub and their official websites\. There have also been calls for GitHub to ban Russian developers from participating\. As a result, on March 2nd, GitHub stated the Russia\-Ukraine conflict, pledging to \&\#34;continue to ensure that free and open source services are available to everyone, including Russian developers\.\&\#34;

However, bans are still occurring, and Russian developers, even former employees of Russian companies and open source contributors from Russia, have been mistakenly removed from their contributions to open source projects\. There have also been several enterprise\-level \&\#34;sanctions\&\#34; where open source companies have either suspended their operations in Russia or announced bans on Russian code contributions\.

On the other hand, there have been instances of extreme behavior, and the node\-IPC incident has finally alerted the entire open source community\. The act of using open source as a platform for toxic behavior has crossed all boundaries of decency\. It was not until OSI published a blog post condemning this behavior titled \&\#34;Open Source Protests Ultimately Harm Open Source\&\#34; that the issue was addressed\.

In short, what can, and cannot open source people do, and what should and should not be done in the face of the highly volatile international political situation? All are exceedingly tricky questions\!

### Complex Relationships Between Governments and Open Source in Various Countries

In the 2021 open source Chronicle, we observed that \&\#34;national open source policies will have a major impact on the future of the open source world,\&\#34; but mainly discusses the role of national policies in promoting the open source industry\. By 2022, we will be observing more and more complex phenomena\. The U\. S\. focus is on open source security\. The U\. S\. White House convened the open source Foundation and IT giants twice in January and May to discuss open source software security\.

In Europe, the focus is more on open source competition from the United States\. On September 14, 2008, the General Court of the European Union ruled to uphold a record fine of €4\.1 billion for monopolistic practices against Countrywide for \&\#34;bundling Countrywide Search / Chrome with Android\.\&\#34;

The odd one in Asia is the ban on VLC in India\. Since February, the Indian government has blocked the website and download links of the VLC player project\. In October, VLC player developers threatened to sue the Indian government, so the embargo was lifted in November\. From the beginning of blocking VLC, and now unblocked, the Indian government has not made any statement, nor has it provided Vide LAN Foundation and the Indian public with a reason for blocking VLC, which is indeed puzzling\.

In China, following the 14th Five\-Year Plan in 2021, in 2022, the country further proposed the Annual Promotion Plan for the Implementation of the Outline for the Construction of a Strong Intellectual Property State and the 14th Five\-Year Plan and the General Office of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission\&\#39;s Guidance on the Digital Transformation of the Banking and Insurance Industry\. In December, the three ministries jointly issued the Regulations on the Administration of the Deep Synthesis of Internet Information Services\. This will also have a profound impact on AIGC and the open source sector\.

In short, the government can impose various actions and policies on the open source industry and the open source ecosystem, and the consequences remain to be seen and evaluated\.

### More Chinese Individuals Exerting Influence in the Open Source Community

In 2022, there were several positive news from international foundations\. In March, Jiang Ning was elected as a director of the Apache Foundation, and Du Junping was re\-elected as the Chair of the LF AI\&amp;DATA Board\. In August, Tina Tsou was selected as the Chair of the LF Edge Board\. Particularly noteworthy is Tina, the first Chinese woman to serve as the Enterprise Internet Engineering Task Force \(IETF\) Working Group Chair and the youngest rapporteur from Asia in the history of the International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector \(ITU\-T\)\. She has also served as the Chair of the Akraino Technical Steering Committee\.

According to CSDN \&\#39;s \&\#34;2022 China open source Contribution Report\&\#34;, we can also see more data:

- Number of Chinese open source contributors, worldwide 9\.5%

- Chinese developers lead open source projects, accounting for 12\.5% of the world

- Global Companies Contributing to open source TOP 50, China vs\. 20%

- International open source Project TOP 50, Only two seats for China

In a certain sense: It\&\#39;s already good, but not good enough yet\.\.\.

### Open Source Reports and Rankings Released, Mixed Feelings Arise

Since 2015, KAIYUANSHE has been publishing an annual \&\#34;China Open Source Annual Report,\&\#34; in 2022, we will finally see more and more like\-minded organizations\. In July, the \&\#34;2022 China Open Source Development Blue Book\&\#34; was officially released\. In August, InfoQ published the \&\#34;2022 China Open Source Development Research and Analysis\.\&\#34; In October, CSDN released the \&\#34;2022 China Open Source Contribution Report\.\&\#34; In November, the OpenAtom Open Source Foundation, X\-lab Open Lab, and Alibaba jointly produced the \&\#34;2022 Open Source Big Data Heat Report\.\&\#34; Since 2020, KAIYUANSHE and SegmentFault have jointly launched the annual selection of the \&\#34;Top 33 Open Source Figures at the Forefront of China\.\&\#34; This event has been held for three consecutive years\. In 2021, KAIYUANSHE and SegmentFault, for the first time, collaborated with the OpenDigger project to select the top 99 developers from the China region based on their collaborative influence on GitHub and named it the \&\#34;China Open Source Code Power\.\&\#34; This itself is a significant signal\! On the one hand, we can see more data, trends, and rankings; on the other hand, we can also see that more and more institutions, companies, and organizations are paying attention to these messages\. However, the GitHub Octoverse report released in November this year also brought some not\-so\-good news: among the 20\.5 million new users this year, India, China, and Brazil have seen the most significant increases, accounting for 32\.4%, 15\.6%, and 11\.6% respectively, with India surpassing China in terms of developer growth\. Of course, the growth rate of Chinese developers seems to have slowed down, which can also be interpreted as more Chinese developers growing on domestic open source platforms\.

<div class="callout">

**Expert Review**

**Jiang Tao**: Github data shows that the number of developers from Hong Kong has increased by 100 million, which is, of course, impossible, but we can only guess that some of the data is from mainland developers using Hong Kong servers to access Github and bring up the Hong Kong IP\.

**Wang Wei**: The growth of Indian developers and their active participation in the open source community is highly noteworthy\. International programs like GSoC \(Google Summer of Code\) and domestic initiatives like OSPP \(Open Source Promotion Plan\) often feature the presence of Indian students\. As two populous countries, both China and India are expected to become significant sources of open source developers, contributing to the vibrant development of the global open source community\.

</div>

### The Development of Open Source Platforms Continues to Evolve and Explore

In the Internet era, an increasingly evident trend is that platforms reign supreme, even in the realm of open source\. Therefore, the actions and decisions of platforms often stir the minds of everyone involved\. From May 2021 to December 2022, the number of GitHub users grew from 65 million to 94 million within a span of 18 months, compared to 50 million users in 2020\. Simultaneously, the domestic platform Gitee has also been experiencing rapid growth\. In 2022, Gitee\&\#39;s code repositories exceeded 25 million, with over 10 million users\. Although there is still a gap in terms of overall numbers compared to GitHub, the growth rate is equally impressive\.

Despite these positive developments, platform measures often face criticism\. GitHub Copilot faced scrutiny, and the SFC even called for \&\#34;Abandoning GitHub, the Time has Come\!\&\#34; By November, a class\-action lawsuit had been filed in the Northern District of California, seeking court approval for $9 billion in statutory damages\. As for future developments, we will continue to monitor them throughout 2023\.

In addition, new policies introduced by Gitee, such as the \&\#34;mandatory review before open sourcing repositories,\&\#34; and the new policy by Microsoft Store, \&\#34;prohibiting commercial sales of open source software on the platform,\&\#34; have also faced widespread criticism\. 

In conclusion, platform policies have far\-reaching implications, and operators must exercise caution in their decisions\.

### The Current Status of Open Sourcers and the Dawn of Individual Heroism

In the early history of free and open source software, we encountered one legendary name after another\. These code heroes ushered in a new era\. However, in today\&\#39;s landscape, the news we often hear is disheartening\. There are frequent reports of renowned open source authors deleting their repositories and disappearing\. They may fall victim to platform exploitation, corporate freeloading, toxic comments forcing them to leave, or simply declaring the end of development and shutting down all projects due to \&\#34;no recourse\&\#34; for appeals\. There are also many unsung heroes silently guarding important open source projects, but their efforts go unnoticed because they remain in the shadows\. 

To summarize, the era of personal heroism is nearing its twilight\. Those solitary individual entrepreneurs are gradually stepping down from the stage and fading away from public view\. As for the open source world, where are we headed next?

The Barrier Factor is a metric used to describe project management risk and defines the number of key project members\.

It is defined as the number of key members that a project can allow to be \&\#34;barreled\&\#34; \(a milder expression would be to leave the project\) before it becomes confused and paralyzed\.

For a detailed definition, refer to CHAOSS: https://chaoss.community/kb/bus\-factor/.

For implementation purposes, the barring factor is the number of developers who have contributed 50% of the active value of the project\.

###### Issue Resolution Cycle

Refers to the average time a GitHub repository spends in a given time interval from when the issue is raised to when it is closed\.

###### Issue Response Period

This refers to the time period in which a GitHub repository is first responded to after an issue is raised in a certain time interval\. The four values are less than one day, 1\-3 days, 3\-7 days, and 7 days or more\.

### Project Analysis Indicators

###### Annotation Coverage

The ratio of commented functions to the total number of functions in the project\. A high value of comment coverage means that the number of functions with comments in the project is higher, and the readability of the code on behalf of it is better\. It is usually recommended to combine business logic and function complexity, sort out the annotation specification of the project, clarify the annotation coverage criteria with business features, and add annotations to complex functions as appropriate\.

###### Static Test Coverage

Static test coverage is the ratio of the number of functions covered by tests to the total number of non\-test functions in the project\. We collect path requirements or naming conventions from popular testing frameworks for each programming language to determine whether a file is a test file based on its path\. If a file is identified as a test file, its functions are categorized as test functions\. Then, through static analysis, we identify the functions called within the test functions, considering these functions as covered by the tests\. The calling relationship has transitivity, meaning that if function A calls function B, and the test function calls function A, functions A and B are considered covered by the test\. 

Static test coverage is calculated as the number of functions covered by tests divided by the total number of non\-test functions in the project, which can be expressed as:

Static test coverage = Number of functions covered by tests / \(Number of functions covered by tests \+ Number of functions not covered by tests\)

Higher test coverage indicates a higher proportion of functions covered by tests in the project, indicating better code reliability\. In the long run, improving test coverage can enhance code quality, reduce maintenance costs, and decrease the difficulty of refactoring\. However, it\&\#39;s important to note that higher test coverage is not always better, as it can increase developers\&\#39; workload\. The cost\-benefit ratio should be considered\. It is recommended to increase unit test coverage for core and complex functions and follow the naming conventions specified by the testing framework for test files and functions\. For the overall project, efficiency and other quality metrics should be considered, and a balanced approach should be taken after a comprehensive analysis\.

###### Code Replication

Code reuse measures the non\-duplication level of functions within a project\.

For the functions in the current project, we utilize a text similarity algorithm based on Minhash and LSH \(Locality Sensitive Hashing\) to identify highly similar functions\. Functions with high similarity are considered duplicates and grouped accordingly\. Code reuse is calculated as the ratio of the number of unique \(non\-duplicate\) functions to the total number of functions in the project\.

Higher code reuse indicates a lower presence of duplicate functions in the project, aligning with the \&\#34;Don\&\#39;t repeat yourself\&\#34; principle and enhancing code maintainability\. Extracting repetitive or similar logic into functions or abstracting them into reusable base classes is generally recommended, as it improves readability and reduces the number of unit tests needed\. However, balancing code reuse and function complexity is important, avoiding excessive encapsulation of code segments that may result in unnecessary complexity\.

## Macro Insights

Note: In the Macro Insights section, the rankings are based on the OpenRank metric for projects\.

In 2022, the number of new open\-source organizations on Gitee exceeded 100,000, with the majority being independent organizations formed by developers voluntarily\. Among the most popular open\-source organizations of the year, established organizations like Dromara and dotNETChina and other older open\-source organizations have matured in their development, having their own set of development standards and internal rules, which serve as good examples for other independent organizations\. 

Additionally, the thriving growth of open\-source organizations like dgiot Open Source Community and anji\-plus, based on small and medium\-sized enterprise open\-source projects, has shown developers the potential for commercialization in the open\-source field\. Open\-source is not limited to large companies; small and medium\-sized enterprises can also carve out their own space by embracing open\-source initiatives\.

### Examples of Open Source Contributions by Region

Gitee has compiled the open\-source contribution percentages of each provincial\-level administrative region from 2020 to 2022\. Among them, Zhejiang Province has experienced rapid growth in open\-source contributions for three consecutive years and ranked first in 2022\. In the Top 10 regions for open\-source contributions in 2022, Zhejiang Province is the only region that has maintained a growth trend for three consecutive years\. 

The scope of open\-source contributions includes Commits, Issues, Pull Requests, Pushes, and Pull Request Reviews

### Gitee Index

An important metric for measuring the quality of an open source project on Gitee is not only the number of Stars, but also the ⸺Gitee Index\.  If a project has a high number of Stars but a low Gitee Index, it may indicate that the project has been neglected or is no longer maintained\. On the other hand, if a project has a relatively low number of Stars but a high Gitee Index, it suggests that the project has great potential and is worth ongoing attention\.

#### Gitee Index Evaluation Dimensions and Algorithms

Based on the experience of Gitee over the years, the Gitee index should contain the following dimensions:

1. Influence

This dimension is used to assess whether developers have genuinely shown interest in the project\. A low number of Stars may indicate that the project has been overshadowed for various reasons\. Conversely, a project without Stars for an extended period may not have reached a wider developer community\.

2. Code Activity

This dimension focuses on the activity level of the project\&\#39;s code\. Projects that have been neglected and no longer receive maintenance from their contributors may exist in significant numbers globally\. However, it is also possible that a project is already well\-developed and requires minimal maintenance\.

3. Community Engagement

This dimension is crucial as a project heavily relies on its contributors\. If a project has only a few actual contributors and experiences key contributors leaving the team, it often leads to the project\&\#39;s discontinuation\. This index is related to the number and stability of contributors\.

4. Team Health

It is also important to note that if there are only so many actual contributors to a project, the withdrawal of key contributors from the team is often the cause of a software hiatus, and this index is related to the number and stability of contributors\.

5. Trending

This dimension is associated with the recent attention a project receives from users\. It reflects the level of interest and popularity of the project within a specific timeframe\.

**Gitee Exponential Algorithm**

The weights of each dimension are divided into the following categories**\. The specific weights of each dimension are shown in the figure below\.**

###### Calculation of Different Dimensions

p is the dimension of the item portrait, f\(i\) are the individual subsets of features under the dimension, w\(i\) are the empirical weights based on the business scenario

###### Final Feature Normalization

where x is the input data, min\(x\(i\)\) is the minimum value among all data samples, and max\(x\(i\)\) is the maximum value among all data samples\. This method allows mapping the data to be contrasted to the \[0,1\] area, allowing the user to visualize comparable data\.

###### The Normalized Project Features are shown in the figure below

Note: Gitee indices are evaluated on a site\-wide relative basis\.

# Commercialization

****

## Overview

In last year\&\#39;s annual open source report, the section on commercialization discussed the underlying drivers for the successful commercialization of open source software, possible commercialization paths for open source companies, investment criteria for open source projects, and case studies\. It provided an overview of the development of commercialization in open source projects from the birth of the term \&\#34;open source\&\#34; in 1998 until last year, sparking lively discussions among the open source community\. 

This year\&\#39;s commercialization section will build upon this foundation and focus more on current market trends and changes\. It is evident that with the accumulation and robust development of domestic open source projects, many projects have gained global influence and a global perspective\. In the context of such a trend, it is worth studying and discussing how to better grasp global opportunities, address common challenges, and promote the globalization of open source software in the process of commercialization\. 

Additionally, this year\&\#39;s commercialization section will further explore the driving factors of open source commercialization, taking into account the overall economic downturn trend, and analyze the market sentiment of the capital market towards open source projects in the past year\. This will help bridge the information gap between open source projects and the capital market\. 

Capital is an important participant in promoting the development of the open source market\. For investment institutions, the following points are often considered when evaluating an open source project: during the product development stage, they focus on whether the enterprise owns code ownership and control and whether it has international competitiveness; during the community operation stage, they mainly assess the enterprise\&\#39;s operational capabilities; and during the commercialization exploration stage, the market fit and maturity of the business model become the main points of attention\. 

As an early advocate and continuous contributor to the open source field, Yunqi Capital has successfully discovered and invested in open source enterprises such as PingCAP, Zilliz, JinaAI, and RisingWaveLab\. 

This chapter is written by the investment team of Yunqi Capital and includes the following main contents:

By country and region, the U\.S\. remains far ahead of the rest of the global market, holding around 75% of the global SaaS market\. The software market in the United States is an unassailable leader in terms of market size, investment and financing activity, and the maturity of business globalization\.

But this gap is also being gradually closed\. Among the emerging markets, Europe, Asia, and Latin America are all experiencing rapid growth in the software industry, with companies spending on software, capital market investment in software development, and the participation of local software companies in the global software market increasing rapidly\. In 2021, Asia\-Pacific companies spent a record 47% more on XaaS than in 2020 and reached 131 billion\(research by ISG\)\.In the Latin American market, the software services industry is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 28% between 2022 and 2026, with major growth coming from Brazil and Mexico\.

The European market is growing particularly rapidly\. In 2021, the European market invested over 100 billion dollars in technology, creating 98 unicorns \[1\]\. In the software services sector, Europe and Israel created 44 SaaS unicorns in 2020, which rose to 81 in 2021, including three unicorns valued at over $10 billion \(Checkout\.com, Talkdesk, and Celonis\) \[2\]\.

**Expert Review**

In 2022, due to deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and the reactive response of capital markets, investment, and IPO activities were significantly reduced\. To better illustrate the commercialization status in typical scenarios, this section mainly uses business data from 2021\.

</div>

In the Chinese market, as enterprises continue to deepen their digital transformation and the scale of the digital economy expands, the software market is also experiencing rapid development\. The impact of the pandemic has led to the widespread adoption of online office and online marketing services, further accelerating the expansion of the software market\. The market size of cloud computing \(IAAS\+PAAS\+SAAS\) is expected to exceed 300 billion yuan in 2023\. Chinese companies\&\#39; expenditure on enterprise software has also been growing rapidly\. From an investment perspective, after a brief cooling\-off period in 2019 and 2020, the capital market once again showed enthusiasm for the enterprise\-level SaaS industry in 2021\. In this process, relying on the huge pool of engineers in China, the market has nurtured a large number of excellent Chinese software products\. From heavily relying on imported advanced technologies in the early stage to gradually achieving a series of domestic substitutions and technological self\-reliance to Chinese software products seeking overseas markets and globalization, the rapid development of China\&\#39;s software industry is evident to all\.

In 2021, among all cloud service providers worldwide, the largest IPO did not come from the United States but from UiPath, an RPA \(Robotic Process Automation\) company originally established in Romania\. In terms of growth rate, Wiz \(a cloud computing security firm\) and Hopin \(an online events platform\) were the fastest\-growing cloud service providers in 2021, taking 14 months and 17 months, respectively, to reach unicorn status\. Following them was Brex, a FinTech company from the United States\. In the primary market, Celonis, a commercial process mining company from Germany, secured funding of $1 billion in 2021, ranking second among cloud service providers, just behind Databricks \($1\.6 billion\) and ahead of Articulate \($1\.5 billion\), both of which are from the United States\.

As a result, software companies worldwide are growing rapidly, both in the second\-tier and first\-tier markets\. They are not the one\-and\-only U\.S\. that many people traditionally think of\.

<div class="callout">

**Expert Review**

**Bai Huancheng**: It is also important to note that Israel is a classic innovative country\. In a sense, there is a connection between Israel and Silicon Valley\. Germany is also a leading industrial software country and has accumulated relevant know\-how\. It is more likely to be opening up its own industry know\-how experience\. It remains essentially a question of the rhythm of development\.

</div>

With the rapid development of the global software market, it is not difficult to understand the trend of open source software to follow the trend of the times and seek commercial globalization\.

#### Software Globalization is a Trend

The software markets across different regions mentioned above are not isolated from each other\. On the contrary, the process of software industry globalization has been underway\. The United States, as the most developed and well\-funded software industry region, has long regarded the world as its market\. From 2015 to 2022, the value of IT services exported by the United States has been increasing year by year, reaching approximately $140 billion in 2019\. Among them, around $36 billion annually comes from software and SaaS services exports\.

Figure 6\. United States IT Services Export \(2015\- 2020\) \(Billions of Dollars\) Source: Statista, US Census Bureau; CompTIA; ID 1011081

In recent years, emerging markets and companies outside the U\.S\. have made globalization one of the most important ways to seek new growth opportunities\. According to a survey conducted by Serena Capital in Europe, of the 250\+ European SaaS companies interviewed, 37% have a presence in the U\.S\. market and have opened or are planning to open an office in the U\.S\. Interestingly, of these companies, more than 45% of companies cited New York as their first choice, which is the highest of any U\.S\. city, surpassing Silicon Valley\. This is closely related to the challenges of globalizing software, which we will discuss later\. In addition, nearly 45% of the software companies that have not yet globalized their business plan to start an international expansion in the next 12 months\.

There are many different drivers for this\.

<div class="callout">

**Expert Review**

**Wei Jianfan**: When it comes to \&\#34;software globalization,\&\#34; the first term that comes to mind for me is \&\#34;global softwarization\.\&\#34; Although they are not exactly the same, both terms are pretty interesting\.

</div>

#### Open Source Software has a Natural Tend toward Globalization 

Setting aside commercialization, for now, open\-source software inherently possesses the attribute of globalization\. Open\-source projects do not discriminate based on contributors\&\#39; backgrounds or nationalities; they embrace and encourage participation from all individuals\. While objective factors such as language, culture, and time zones may impose limitations on the composition of contributors in certain projects, it does not diminish the spirit of open\-source communities welcoming, encouraging, and respecting all contributors\. 

A good open\-source project can attract developers from around the world\. According to data released by GitHub, an average open\-source project on GitHub receives contributions from 41 different countries and regions\. Additionally, as GitHub serves as a hub for global open\-source projects, its user base is becoming increasingly diverse\. Based on 2021 data, the proportion of users from North America decreased by 2\.3% to 31\.5% compared to 2020, while the active user base in all other regions increased\. 

This attribute of globalization is a valuable resource in the process of international expansion for open\-source software companies, as will be discussed in detail in subsequent chapters\.

**Ren Xudong**: The globalization of open source and the competition of software are borderless, and the borderlessness of ecology is related to the boundless cost of the software\.

</div>

#### International Expansion of Open Source Software Companies

For open source software, international expansion has become an important phase in the development journey of many successful open source software companies\. For example, in March 2021, GitLab entered the Chinese market successfully by establishing a joint venture called Jihu\. Red Hat\&\#39;s partner ecosystem spans the globe, and in 2020, Confluent hired Damien Wong, who has over a decade of experience in the Asian software market, from Red Hat\&\#39;s Singapore office to better serve its key Asian clients\. Elastic serves customers from 125 countries worldwide\.

</tbody></table>

#### Shaping a More Mature Corporate Image

Among the many drivers, the factor most recognized by software executives \(42%\) is that successful business globalization enhances the market recognition of a company and creates a more mature external image\. Successful business globalization is a good way to demonstrate a company\&\#39;s ability to improve its operations and the quality of its products\. By successfully going abroad, the company has proven that its own products can meet diversified needs and that its own team can cope with a relatively complex operating environment, which can play a strong role in promoting subsequent global operations or local business expansion\.

For open source companies, this driver is even more pronounced\. Unlike closed\-source companies, which have commercial attributes from their inception, many open source projects do not initially have commercialization as a central consideration\. This makes it possible for many customers to question or hesitate to commercialize open source projects that are subsequently commercialized\. The results of the survey show that successful outbound travel is a model that can quickly increase customer confidence\.

<div class="callout">

**Expert Review**

**Li Zhenning**: Open source currently mostly targets TOB \(business\-to\-business\) users and the most crucial customer acquisition capability is building trust\. Diversified overseas clients undoubtedly serve as one of the best trust endorsements for Chinese enterprises\.

</div>

#### Reducing Reliance on Single\-player Markets

The second\-ranked driver has reduced reliance on a single market \(41%\)\. It is also understandable that in an increasingly complex global business and political environment, diversifying sources of income is one of the main ways to reduce risk\. In today\&\#39;s increasingly competitive software market, relying exclusively on can result in any fluctuation within the market that can have a significant impact on a company and even on the survival of a startup\. Changes in local government policies, new technology iterations, and changes in upstream and downstream markets can all significantly impact a company\&\#39;s business performance\.

Diversifying sources of revenue through globalization is a good way to reduce this risk and provide a cushion for companies to respond to these market changes\.is an effective tool\. For Chinese software companies, the importance of having multiple sources of revenue is also more critical in a large environment where the pace of policy change is relatively fast\.

#### Access to New and Sustainable Development Space

According to the companies surveyed, A successful business globalization can bring about a 13% increase in companies’ direct revenue\. In addition to the direct short\-term revenue boost, more room for growth and imagination was given to companies breaking into overseas markets\. This is one of the key considerations for many software company decision\-makers \(40%\) in their decision to go offshore\. Especially for companies in countries with a relatively limited market for soil\-based software, success in entering a broader market, such as the United States, may have a more significant impact on the company\&\#39;s revenue\.

For Chinese open source software companies, the more mature market size in overseas markets, stronger willingness to pay from clients, and higher software prices are the main driving forces for actively exploring software globalization and expanding into international markets\. In the case of open source software, if there’s a free\-to\-use version, the willingness of domestic companies to pay is significantly lower than companies in mature markets, such as Europe or the United States\. The pricing difference between the domestic and European/ US markets is huge for the same product\. Therefore, the potential of domestic open\-source software is enormous when it successfully penetrates into overseas mature markets\.

### Challenges for Business Globalization

#### Adapting Products for Better Localization\.

According to the questionnaire results, the major challenge for software going abroad is localization in overseas markets\. The challenge is not only in techniques but also in understanding the customer needs in a strange environment\. A series of differences in language, culture, and time difference make it more challenging to understand the needs of customers remotely\.

Localization not only lies in product function but also in pricing The willingness to pay for software, especially open\-source software, varies considerably from country to country\. It is often impossible to transpose the original pricing ideas and systems to international markets\. For software companies going aboard, it is a must to understand the market’s demands, brand recognition, and willingness to pay accurately, and set the most optimal pricing strategy according to these data points\.

<div class="callout">

**Expert Review**

**Jiang Ning**: The introduction and expansion of open source projects involve establishing numerous local communities\. Relying on the effort of local communities can effectively address the localization issues of open source projects\.** **

</div>

#### Multiple Challenges of Overseas Market Operation\.

In addition to product\-related challenges, overseas market operations also face multi\-sided challenges for software companies that are leaving the comfort zone of their home market for the first time\.

First, before the company started the globalization process, it was a challenge to enter the overseas market\. This requires a comprehensive evaluation of a number of factors, including the demand for the company\&\#39;s products in each market, the willingness to pay for the software, and the strength of the local competition\. Choosing the right market to enter can determine the company\&\#39;s subsequent development\.

Secondly, the localization of sales and marketing is also a big challenge\. The most straightforward and common way to do this is to build a local team\. However, the downside of this strategy is that it requires a large amount of investment at an early stage\. In a survey of software company executives, 37% of participants say the major obstacle to global expansion is the investment required in sales and marketing

Finally, recruiting local teams is a challenge that can not be avoided when implementing a globalization strategy\. How to recruit talents who meet the company\&\#39;s requirements and fit the company\&\#39;s culture in an unfamiliar environment requires a lot of effort from the company\&\#39;s decision\-makers to design and implement\.

Chinese software companies often face trust and regulation issues in the process of globalization\. To solve these problems, we need to work together on attitude, organizational culture, and product design, and we need to insist on it consistently\. Take PingCAP as an example\. As a pioneer of Chinese software going abroad, PingCAP insisted on the internationalization road from the beginning of its development and successfully launched its star product TiDBdatabase overseas\. The core team at PingCAP has suggested that solving trust issues is a threshold in the globalization of Chinese software operations, especially for core infrastructure software like the database\. Compared with the software connection between Europe and the US, and other Western countries, it is clear that the globalization of Chinese software needs to do more to gain the trust of customers in this aspect\.

<div class="callout">

**Expert Review**

**Li Zhenning**: We also need to see some of the compliance requirements for Chinese companies operating under local legal rules\. The short\-sighted actions taken in some countries in recent years have also served as a reminder to some extent that companies going abroad need to be more mindful of the challenges of operating in compliance with local laws\.

</div>

#### Changing Organizational Structure to Accommodate Global Operations\.

In the process of a software company going abroad, adjusting the organizational structure to accommodate global operations is also a necessary change\.:The main challenges are to clarify and maintain the company\&\#39;s focus in the process of globalization, to change the internal organizational structure to accommodate the multi\-country, multi\-market operation model, and to establish and ensure consistency and continuity of corporate culture among different offices in each country\.

1. the mission and vision of a company are crucial for its long\-term stability and development\. In undergoing significant transformations such as globalization, it is vital for the company\&\#39;s senior management to carefully consider how to iterate and evolve based on the specific circumstances of different markets, maintaining a balance between adaptability and focus\.

2. Regarding organizational structure and incentive mechanisms, there can be significant differences between a local company and a globalized company\. During the initial stages of international expansion, it is essential to establish an efficient organizational framework and implement proper authorization and management practices to facilitate rapid growth\.

3. Diversity in talent is both a resource and a challenge\. For a team with limited international work experience, understanding and respecting different market cultures, coordinating the diverse cultural and work habits across various country offices, and establishing a unified company culture requires a delicate balance\. This tests the management capabilities of senior executives in software companies beyond their product\-related competencies\.

#### Challenges Faced by Open Source Companies in Operating Globalized Open Source Communities

The challenges mentioned above are not only encountered by open source software companies in the process of globalization, but all software companies are facing similar difficulties\. To take a step back, not only software companies, but almost all global companies need to solve similar problems\. On top of these difficulties, however, open source software companies have another challenge to address \- building an international open source community\.

For open source software companies, the open source community is crucial and plays a significant role in determining the success or failure of their open source software\. GC Lionetti, the CMO of Confluent, expressed in a recent event that Confluent\&\#39;s corporate development began five years before the company was founded through community development\. He emphasized the importance of the community for open source software companies, mainly when they aim to expand their audience in the early stages\.

A successful open source project must have an active open source community\. Running a thriving local open source community is already challenging, and expanding such an active community globally is even more difficult\. Among them, the following difficulties are usually the most troubling for open source software companies\.

- Language Differences: Unlike closed\-source software, which usually only needs to face the problem of poor communication between different languages in a working environment, the open source community has more frequent communication between members\. The success of open source communities is also built on the premise that their members are active and communicative\. This includes clear documentation, communication between developers and users on issues, code markup, etc\. The difference in language has had a much greater impact on the open source community than the closed\-source software\.

- Cultural Differences: Cultural differences in countries can also affect the operation of open source communities\. At the recent KAIYUANSHE COSCon commercialization roundtable, Dr\. Xiao Han, founder of JinaAI, mentioned that members of the Asian open source community expect a faster response than members of the European and American communities\. Therefore, when confronting communities in different countries, open source software companies must adapt their community operation models to fit the different countries\&\#39; customs\. As an open source project becomes increasingly international, there will be more and more communication between different cultures\. It is a challenge for open source software companies to create and ensure a diverse and mutually respectful community environment\.

- Location/Time Difference: Although people are increasingly accustomed to telecommuting and communication, proper offline face\-to\-face communication is undoubtedly very useful for community building and operation\. This is a difficult balance for an open source software company at its early stage of globalization\. The time difference  will inevitably affect the communication and response time between community members in different countries, which is also a challenge for open source projects with active communication\.

<div class="callout">

**Expert Review**

Why doesn\&\#39;t the time difference affect the communication of the Apache collaboration? The core issue is our lack of compatibility with the open source communication model\.

</div>

### The Path to Global Commercialization

Despite the difficulties faced by the globalization of the open source software business, there is a large number of open source software companies that have successfully developed overseas markets\. For example, Conﬂuent generated 36% of its revenue from more than 100  countries worldwide for the full year 2021; another successful open source software company, Elastic,  had customers from more than 125 countries worldwide as of April 30, 2022\. And thanks to its flexible office model, it has employees in over 40 countries\. Elastic is also partnering with cloud merchants worldwide, with over 40 locations, to better serve customers around the world\. Both companies have made international expansion a crucial strategic objective in their annual reports\.

**For open source software companies interested in international expansion currently, the main paths to commercial globalization include the following****:**

#### Globalization of Open Source Ecosystem

For open source software, the construction of the open source ecosystem is the core competency, which includes the construction of the open source project itself, the improvement of the open source community, and the participation of the open source foundation\. As a software company looking to expand internationally, how to maximize the use and operation of the global open source ecosystem plays a decisive role in its successful globalization\.

#### 1\) Building Highly Active Globalized Open Source Communities

In our previous article on the challenges of globalizing open source companies, we mentioned that the open source community is one of the most critical factors that determine the success or failure of open source software\. Therefore, in the process of globalizing open source software, the first thing that needs to be considered is the operation of the open source community\.

In response to the previously mentioned challenges of running a global open source community, open source software companies, as organizers of open source projects, can also do more to provide targeted solutions\. For example, we need to ensure high\-quality translation of files before international expansion, especially on README and some primary files, to ensure the translated content is clear and easy to understand, and to minimize the language barrier for foreign contributors and users; our community operation team also needs to take the initiative to understand and adapt to the different working habits of open source communities in different countries, and actively conduct local activities to increase the participation and motivation of members\. The company\&\#39;s community operations team also needs to take the initiative to understand and adapt to the different working habits of the open source communities in different countries, and actively conduct local\-based activities to increase the participation and motivation of members and reduce the gap caused by time difference and distance\.

Take Elastic for example\. Elastic has always placed a high strategic priority on the global open source community\. On Elastic\&\#39;s website, you can find a wide range of sessions in 12 languages\. More recently, the company has also been conducting a series of summits around the world to increase the impact of its products and community cohesion\. This includes the ElasticON summit and the Elastic Community Conference\. The ElasticON Summit is a more diverse summit for the public, while the Elastic Community Conference is a technical forum for the open source community\. But both series summits have globalization built into every detail of their operations\. In addition to online summits for a global audience, ElasticON has established offline summits in Europe \(Amsterdam\), Asia \(Japan\), and the Americas \(Washington, DC\) to enhance face\-to\-face communication\. The Community Conference is specifically tailor\-made for members around the world and is set up as a rolling 2\-day event, without the need to schedule the conference charter in a particular time zone\. The sharing sessions will be conducted in English, French, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and Portuguese\. This arrangement underscores the importance, respect, and inclusiveness of Elastic to the global community\.

###### 2\) Active Involvement in International Open Source Organizations and Foundations

Active participation in the International open source Foundation is another good way to expand international exposure\. For many open source projects seeking internationalization, having the endorsement of an internationally recognized foundation can be an excellent catalyst for further development\. In this regard, the participation of Chinese open source projects in the international arena is also increasing rapidly\.\&lt;1\&gt;The two most well\-known international open source foundations ⸺ Apache Software Foundation and Linux Foundation ⸺ are starting to see an increasing number of Chinese open source projects joining and graduating from the Foundation\.

<div class="callout">

**Expert Review**

**Jiang Ning**: In 2022, 6 open source projects from China joined Apache Software Foundation incubators, and 6 China projects successfully graduated from Apache Software Foundation top\-level projects\.

</div>

The benefits that open source software companies can gain by running these open source communities are also significant\. In addition to gaining better international exposure and visibility, open source software companies can also use these channels to understand the needs of the native soil better, gain inbound marketing and open up overseas markets\. Compared with closed\-source software, open source software has apparent advantages in this respect\. This is further evidence of the importance of open source operations\.

#### Globalization of Services

As a mature software company, post\-sales services are essential and highly important\. Therefore, in the process of global expansion, the globalization of support services is crucial for the company\&\#39;s long\-term development\. As Elastic highlighted in their financial report, they achieved comprehensive coverage in multiple languages by deploying support teams in 25 countries, providing 24/7 support throughout the year, and ensuring their customers receive timely and high\-quality service\. For companies in the early stages of globalization, achieving such extensive coverage may not be realistic\. Still, companies must have a strategic plan for global service deployment from the early stages of their projects\. When the time is correct during the global expansion, proactively deploy local commercial and service teams\. The ideal team should have a global perspective and local business experience\. As regional commercialization matures, establish local offices and regional headquarters to facilitate rapid expansion\. For example, MuleSoft, which was acquired by Salesforce in 2018, opened up international markets by establishing Asia\-Pacific and South America regional headquarters in Sydney and Buenos Aires as early as 2013\. Such a setup also helped them further develop localized sales and services\.

#### Globalization of Sales \(Cloud\)

Similar to globalized services, the early establishment of global sales is also a necessary part of the business globalization process for open source software companies\. A presence can include setting up local teams, establishing local/regional offices, or forming partnerships with local enterprises\. For example, as mentioned earlier, Red Hat\&\#39;s partner ecosystem is one of the critical avenues for its efficient global sales\. Confluent also hired Damien Wong from Red Hat\&\#39;s Singapore office to quickly and efficiently build local sales and service teams in the Asia\-Pacific region\.

Additionally, leveraging the active open source community allows open source software companies to directly connect with daily users of their products, significantly reducing customer acquisition costs\. This characteristic will be amplified in the process of globalization\. Unlike closed\-source software which requires substantial time and financial investment for international sales, open source software companies can benefit from cultivating the international open source community\. By engaging with the community, companies can reach developers or IT professionals within enterprises and utilize the community as an initial marketing platform to spread the company\&\#39;s reputation and its products\.

**In global software sales, two trends are extremely helpful for the globalization of open source software sales\.**

- International markets \(especially European and American enterprises\) are becoming more and more comfortable with the public cloud, thus lowering the threshold for cross\-border sales\. Adaptation to the public cloud has greatly increased the degree of standardization of software products\. open source software companies can accelerate their expansion by entering into strategic partnerships with public cloud service providers\. Deployments on the public cloud also significantly lower the threshold for remote sales, providing a great deal of convenience for companies in the early stages of international expansion\.

- Compared to the traditional Sales\-Led Growth model, the Product\-Led Growth PLG \(PLG\) is increasingly being adopted and promoted in mature international markets\.

Unlike the traditional business model of closed\-source software companies, open source companies inherently carry the attributes of PLD\. open source software companies are more efficient and less expensive to sell than traditional companies in the customer acquisition and conversion process\. Especially in the international marketplace, it is more effective to speak in terms of products Athan in terms of sales\.

In addition, for Chinese open source software companies, their open source attributes are also a good way to solve the trust threshold mentioned above\. The core team at PingCAP has pointed out that through open source, Chinese software companies can gain the endorsement of developers and users faster and more effectively, greatly reducing the level of skepticism among customers\. At the same time, we can save a lot of effort and expenses on wireless and publicity in foreign markets\.

<div class="callout">

**Expert Review**

**Bian Sikang**: For ToB tools or infrastructure software, where the product form allows closed source or open source, open source can bring better PLG results because the community can serve as a new place to better operate the product and fully develop the code and product form\. In the international market, a good open source community, core files, and technical content can help in product discovery, iteration, and growth\.

</div>

### The Choice between Globalization and Localization

For most software companies, the global marketplace has a lot of appeal\. A broader market abroad, a higher willingness to pay, and a more mature competitive environment could all contribute to the next step in the company\&\#39;s development\. But before an open source company can aggressively expand into overseas markets, it needs to address whether its own company is suitable for globalization\. The primary considerations in this area are twofold:

#### Whether the Demand Addressed by the Product Global in Nature

Every country and market has its unique market demands\. Especially in enterprise software services, different countries develop very different demands due to cultural, policy, regulatory, and market differences\. Of course, there are many typical demands, such as data management and analysis\. These demands have also driven the successful globalization of open\-source software companies, such as Elastic and PingCap\. 

However, many demands are highly localized\. For example, the tax policies of different countries may give rise to entirely different client requirements\. In such an environment, many products may not meet the demands of customers in international markets\. These products are more suitable for deepening their presence in the local market\.

#### Whether the Technical Characteristics of the Product Support Globalization

Another factor to consider is whether the company\&\#39;s technology is globally competitive\. As companies look to enter mature markets such as Europe and the US, open source software companies need to consider whether their technical capabilities are advantageous in a more mature market\. If so, does the company have the confidence to build a moat to protect the company\&\#39;s core competencies? A team with a proven market and technology in the soil may not be able to maintain a similar competitive edge in the international marketplace\.

## Driving Factors of Open Source Commercialization

The participation in open source projects is extensive, and the system and content are complex\. Exploring the driving factors from source code development to commercial success is an important issue\. Open source project entrepreneurs need to closely align with commercialization and market demands, and fully leverage the value brought by open source\. In this chapter, we combine the development history of commercializing open source software, successful commercialization cases from global and Chinese markets, and distill the key driving factors for commercializing open source software\. These factors revolve around the open source community, open source products, and lean governance that run through the entire project\. However, due to the multitude of factors involved, the driving factors for successful commercialization go beyond the content presented in this chapter\. We welcome readers to engage in open discussions and contribute additional insights\.

### Open Source Community Development as the Foundation Barrier for Commercialization

#### Identify The Significance of Open Source Community for Enterprises

Community building is the foundation and core of constructing an open source ecosystem\. Community development supports the commercialization goals of enterprises through code, products, and users\. The vitality of open source projects lies in the wide inclusion of users, developers, individuals, and companies into the ecosystem, driving community prosperity through usage and contributions and fueling the flywheel of product iteration\. Therefore, open source is not simply about opening the source code once the product is mature\. Even in cases where the fundamental product is not yet perfect, the community ecosystem can drive rapid optimization, making it more aligned with real and general needs and enabling the realization of product implementation from 0 to 1\. For products that have entered the commercialization stage, open source can harness the power of the community to facilitate rapid iteration in practical scenarios, catalyzing the journey from 1 to 10\. We have observed that a diverse and open community culture, rich community content, and engaging community activities play a positive role in the continuous and proactive development of the community\. While code can be easily reused, community ecosystems cannot be replicated\. What truly energizes open source is the product iteration and user growth driven by the community\.

**Wang Xiaohu**: Products and community users drive each other in a dual\-wheel fashion, with community governance as the connecting axle\. The convenience of participation acts as a lubricant, while the driving force stems from addressing pain points and meeting demands more effectively\.

</div>

#### Constructing a Pluralistic and Open Community

The vitality of open source communities stems from diverse and open community ecosystems\. The community ecosystem consists of various roles, including operators, contributors, and users\. Operators are responsible for community management and maintenance, contributors participate in providing content, and users utilize the code and products, sometimes engaging in discussions\. Contributors can include employees of companies, students, personnel from universities and research institutions, and organizations joining for commercial purposes\. Open\-source contributions embed ideas from different backgrounds, reducing barriers posed by limited talent and product development costs\.

Contributors extend different scenarios based on the underlying code foundation, develop upper\-layer applications, and serve as the driving force for product improvement and commercialization\. Taking the openEuler community as an example, based on the EulerOS foundation, it has nurtured SIG groups related to kernel, cloud\-native, applications, middleware, and other areas\. The community also actively involves external companies contributing functionality modules and application extensions\. For example, Qihoo 360 actively participates in security\-related SIG groups, enhancing the operating system\&\#39;s network security capabilities\. StarrySky Data Solutions \(SDS\), a Ceph vendor, contributes to establishing the Ceph SIG group, assisting with Ceph integration and distributed storage scenario adaptation for openEuler releases\. Aerospace ChinaNetcom has joined the community and contributed to multiple SIGs, promoting the compatibility between the openEuler operating system and its \&\#34;Aerospace Smart Cloud\&\#34; series of products in intelligent aerospace scenarios\.

Enterprise contributors can also help adapt open source software to upstream and downstream hardware and cloud vendors\. OpenCloudOS, an open source operating system community led by Tencent, is built upon such supply chain collaboration\. The initial founding members include Phytium, Loongson, Shanghai Zhaoxin, and other chip manufacturers, as well as leading participants from the data center equipment and software providers like Inspur Information\. The operating system is the foundational software connecting the upstream and downstream ecosystems\. The involvement of enterprises enables software to be seamlessly integrated into the industry chain at a lower cost, strengthening the connection between upstream/downstream partners and community software products\. In the current diverse landscape of computing and storage resources, open source communities can break free from the limitations of developers\&\#39; industry knowledge, facilitating low\-cost commercialization of products\.

Users are also important participants in the community\. A diverse and open community ecosystem should lower the barriers for users, encouraging them to actively engage in usage, ask questions, and interact with others\. Users play a vital role in attracting attention to open source projects and are integral to community and product influence building\. For example, the image generation model StableDiffusion, open\-sourced in August 2022, has garnered 4\.8k GitHub Forks since October\. It has spawned many products based on this model\. Currently, StableDiffusion has accumulated over 10 million daily active users across various channels\.

Users can also grow into potential contributors\. According to a survey by InfoQ, the most common participation methods in the domestic open source community have shifted from cloning code and commenting on issues to joining open source interest groups and submitting pull requests\. Users are transitioning from consumers of open source to producers of open source\.

Participants in a diverse and open community



#### Enriching Community Content Construction

Community content includes documentation, videos, courses, e\-books, and other forms of media\. The content production encourages participants to share the community\&\#39;s achievements and engage in collaborative development\. 

Documentation serves as the foundational content in the open\-source community, relying on the collective efforts of numerous developers within the community\. It incorporates historical contributions and enables other participants to use and further develop\. Additionally, community operators must regularly update and maintain the documentation to ensure the efficient production of open\-source content\. 

Compared to developers, users may have weaker development capabilities, but their questions and meaningful discussions are also vital components of the open\-source content\. Open interaction helps collect user feedback and understand their needs\. The community\&\#39;s official representatives should promptly address questions in forums, creating an ecosystem of multi\-party discussions\. The results of these discussions can also inform the synchronization and updating of the documentation, thereby driving product optimization\. 

As the user ecosystem grows, there is a diverse demand for different forms of content\. Seasoned users and proficient developers require simple and user\-friendly APIs, while new users benefit from tutorials and beginner guides that provide guidance\. 

The development of multimedia formats promotes innovative forms of content creation\. Taking PingCAP\&\#39;s content matrix as an example, in addition to blog series on source code analysis and open\-source community participation guides, the company has published the e\-book \&\#34;TiDB in Action\&\#34; about TiDB technology\. This book was collaboratively written by community members, leveraging the collaborative advantage of the open\-source community\. PingCAP also conducts online Paper Reading live streams on Bilibili\. For potential users, PingCAP offers PingCAP University online video courses and certification, helping enterprises and individuals become familiar with distributed relational database systems and gain a comprehensive understanding of TiDB products\. They have also launched an English version of the TiDB Academy course to cater to overseas markets\. Open\-source communities can leverage videos, live streams, social platforms, and other mediums to expand their content ecosystem, facilitating community influence\-building and market education\.

<div class="callout">

**Expert Review**

**Jiang Ning**: Content building combined with SEO can reach vertical users efficiently, attract and accumulate initial fans for the development of the project community, and involve them in the content building to further build a sense of belonging to the community\.

</div>

#### Events Promote Outreach and Growth

Community activities enhance influence\-building and promote the growth of community participants\. Open\-source communities have social solid characteristics and rely heavily on disseminating technology and community\. The activity system includes various forms, such as online competitions, offline meetups, and large\-scale conferences\. In these activities, open\-source communities should leverage the role of enterprise users, evangelists, and KOLs to promote the awareness of open\-source technology and principles, enabling projects to resonate with users and enhance community engagement and user stickiness\. 

Both domestic and international open\-source enterprises provide rich examples of activities\. Databricks has organized events like the Data\+AI competition, conferences, and AI and big data discussions\. They have hosted multiple meetups and workshops in the financial data services domain\. Domestic open\-source projects also attach great importance to conducting activities\. For example, PingCAP\&\#39;s activity matrix includes high\-performance and high\-difficulty project competitions like Hackathon and Bug Hunting and sharing events like InfraMeetup and the annual TiDB Technology Conference \(DevCon\) in the infrastructure field\. Zilliz, focusing on unstructured data processing and analysis, held the first Unstructured Data Summit in 2022, and their regular ArchMeetup has seen over a hundred sessions\. Yunqi Capital also actively organizes open\-source\-related events, collaborating with organizations such as Baiyulan Open Source, Huawei MindSpore, and KAIYUANSHE to invite professionals in the open\-source software field for BBQ\-style discussions\. 

Online activities have broader user coverage and relatively lower costs, while offline activities facilitate the exchange and collision of experts and industry participants, which is equally important\. Building a rich community activity ecosystem not only serves as a means of product and community promotion but also stimulates collective intelligence among community participants to address specific issues, thereby improving product performance and practicality\.

Rich types of community activities

### Building Competitiveness for Commercial Open Source Products

#### Racetrack and Innovation Determine Product Market Space\.

To gain user recognition in the early stages, open\-source projects need to clearly answer what significant problems they can solve and how they differentiate themselves from others in the field based on their technological expertise\. Innovativeness is a critical factor that demonstrates both technical and time barriers\. 

Open\-source projects are products of the time, serving the emerging needs of the era\. In the 1990s, as the era of information technology emerged, the open\-sourcing of operating systems like BeOS and Linux played a crucial role in the history of operating systems and the entire open\-source ecosystem\. In the early 21st century, with the widespread adoption of the internet and the growth of data, the era of big data began, and open\-source systems like Hadoop gained significant traction\. This led to the emergence of commercial companies such as Cloudera and Hortonworks, which were built upon the Hadoop ecosystem\. As the demand for flexible and efficient data processing grew, projects like Confluent based on the messaging system Kafka and Databricks based on the computing engine Spark also emerged within the ecosystem\. With the development of cloud computing, open\-source projects such as Docker and Kubernetes came into play, ushering in the era of cloud\-native applications\. In recent years, the rapid advancement of AI has given rise to open\-source platforms like Hugging Face and AI models like StableDiffusion, which have garnered widespread attention in their respective domains\. 

The iterative nature of demand and technology creates market space for open\-source projects, and successful commercialization of these projects often becomes a significant symbol of the era\. Successful open\-source projects seize opportunities in the early stages of domain development, driving technological innovation and application\. When professionals in related fields understand the project and see their needs being effectively addressed, they are more likely to utilize the code and contribute to the community, leading to user growth for the product\.

Important Open Source Projects in the Evolution of the Times

A complete and user\-friendly community edition product is derived from open source code and community contributions\. It should also cater to a broader range of needs, enabling users, businesses, and organizations with less development capacity but similar requirements to be willing to use it\. The transition from project\-community fit to product\-market fit is the first step in commercializing open source software\.

#### Commercialized Products Hit the Pain Point of Payment\.

Careful consideration of payment scenarios is necessary to commercialize an excellent open source project\. While the open source community provides a vast array of content, there is still a certain gap to be bridged to address the core pain points of commercialization\. Enterprise customers may require faster and more accessible, and easier\-to\-use software and services\. Managers need to integrate the code and patches contributed by community participants into commercial products\. The value of paid products can lie in features that cater more effectively to user scenarios, enterprise\-level compliance and security, and user\-friendly SaaS services\. Product refinement should be based on customer profiles and specific use cases\. Different requirements arise when targeting the domestic market or global markets, different industries, various customer scales, and public or private clouds\.

Enhancing the Value\-market fit and developing open source products suitable for commercialization is necessary to attract sufficient paid engagement for an excellent open source project\. In a previous report, we explored various commercial open source models based on user pain points\. These models include support, hosting, restrictive licensing, open core, and hybrid licensing\. Enterprises must identify users\&\#39; willingness to pay and provide corresponding products and services\.

For products following an open\-core model, ensuring that the community edition product has sufficiently complete functional modules is important\. The paid version should be tailored to meet the specific needs of paid users\. For example, GitLab Enterprise Edition integrates features such as LDAP protocol and log auditing for teams with over a hundred members, offering custom access control and workflow management for enterprise users\. Confluent\&\#39;s commercial edition targets enterprise users and provides advanced features such as load balancing, cross\-datacenter backup, and security protections, differentiating itself in terms of performance and security\. For hosted models like Databricks and Acquia, the emphasis is on lightweight SaaS services, reducing the initial heavy investment required for private deployments, providing flexibility and scalability, and aligning with the cloud adoption trend\. These providers also offer advanced feature integration in their closed\-source cloud\-based versions\.

#### Rapid Iteration to Maintain Competitive Competitiveness

Software development companies need to maintain agility and respond quickly to market demands through product iterations\. Traditional closed\-source products follow a lifecycle from introduction, growth, and maturity, to eventual decline, resulting in decreased users over time and eventual obsolescence\. However, the growth model of open source accelerates iterations and introduces a virtuous cycle of product iteration and user growth, ensuring the product\&\#39;s longevity in the market\.

Product Growth Curve

Open source communities have inherent advantages in agile development and rapid iteration\. Developers, who are also users of the product, are numerous and diverse, enabling them to respond to emerging needs for secondary development quickly\. This reduces the lag time for enterprises to wait for market feedback and updates, allowing them to address user requirements promptly\. Additionally, user\-generated content \(UGC\) facilitates the rapid generation of targeted solutions that can be integrated into product updates\. For example, StableDiffusion, an image generation model that was open\-sourced in August 2022, received community contributions in September to enable local execution on M1 Mac, achieved a 50% speed improvement within two months in October, and saw community contributions integrating it with closed\-source software such as Photoshop and Figma\. 

In a market with increasing complexity, products need continuous iteration to keep up with the evolution of upstream and downstream software and hardware\. The development agility that serves user needs is a unique barrier to entry for open source projects\.

### Lean Governance for Cost Reduction and Efficiency

#### Open Source Protocols are a Prerequisite for Open Source Governance

open source licenses define the rules for accessing and using open source code\. As open source software has evolved, various types of open source licenses have emerged\. These include permissive licenses such as Apache, BSD, and MIT, which allow for the use, modification, redistribution, and creation of proprietary derivatives\. There are also strict licenses like GPL and LGPL, which emphasize the viral nature of open source and require derivatives to be released under the same license\.

Some Open Source Protocol Types and Rules

Source: InfoQ Report



In recent years, the conflict between open\-source companies and cloud providers has led to changes in the licensing of open\-source projects\. This includes instances where commercialization\-focused companies have driven the modification of open\-source project licenses \(such as MongoDB changing from AGPLv3 to SSPL, and Elastic changing from APLv2 to a dual license of SSPL and Elastic License\)\. These changes reflect the response of open source companies to address the challenge of their commercial space being encroached upon by cloud providers who use open source without contributing back to the community\. On the other hand, in terms of overall industry trends, the share of loose protocols in the open\-source software space continues to increase year by year, accounting for 78% of open\-source projects in 2021, with more projects choosing the path of highly permissive open source ecosystems, allowing for greater freedom in the use and modification of the code\. 

<div class="callout">

**Expert Review**

**Li Zhenning**: This is a good step forward\. The loose license allows more developers and users to freely embrace open source\. On the other hand, the strict license agreement also continues to be highly used\. More than half of the top 10 license types used worldwide are still strictly licensed\.

</div>

Selection of Open Source Protocols for Open Source Projects

Source: The Complete Guide for Open Source Licenses 2022

Restrictive licenses can protect the interests of open\-source companies when used appropriately, but they may also result in a loss of community engagement and project adoption\. On the other hand, permissive licenses contribute to the community\&\#39;s thriving to a certain extent, allowing for the full realization of the advantages of open source and the formation of product barriers\. However, changing open\-source licenses can incur additional costs\. In the case of the 6\-year dispute between Elastic and AWS, it required significant resources in terms of legal and public relations aspects related to law and the open source ecosystem\.

Different types of licenses are designed to protect the rights of open\-source developers and maintain a healthy open\-source ecosystem\. With the development of AI and deep learning, ethical concerns regarding AI tools and the content they produce have also gained attention\. The Creative ML OpenRAIL\-M license, adopted by the open\-source model Stable Diffusion, is a license type designed for open\-source AI models\. This license allows open access, use, and distribution while prohibiting misuse in violation of relevant laws and ethics\. It emphasizes responsible usage to minimize harm to society and ensure the appropriate application of open\-source projects\. 

Therefore, determining the appropriate open source license and establishing suitable access rules at different stages of an open source project\&\#39;s development to mitigate potential risks should be a primary consideration for commercialization\.

#### Community governance is the foundation of an ever\-growing community quartz

After establishing a project and open source community, community governance becomes crucial\. Operators need to determine the community\&\#39;s organizational structure, define process specifications, and maintain and manage the affairs and content

Research conducted by the Linux Foundation and Harvard University\&\#39;s Innovation Science Lab found that much of the widely used open\-source software is developed and maintained by a small number of contributors, with 94% of projects having less than 10 developers responsible for more than 90% of the code\. There are also a large number of items that have not been updated for a long time\.

As the open\-source community continues to grow and the system becomes more complex, governance becomes even more important\. GitLab tried in 2022 to automatically remove inactive projects from free user accounts in order to reduce costs but was met with objections from developers and had to turn them into object repositories available to all\. In addition, when developers make a certain number of contributions to the community but do not receive positive feedback, they may stop maintenance or even \&\#34;delete the repository and run away,\&\#34; resulting in a loss of contributed content, which is detrimental to the open\-source ecosystem\. Therefore, community governance is often necessary for the healthy development of community collaboration\.

The community holds different levels of users, contributors, and administrators, and operators need to clarify the responsibilities and authority of different participants at different levels, and how people move between levels\. In the process of collaboration, the community also needs to clarify a series of process specifications: The specification of the code format, comments, and submission process can facilitate the interaction between different participants, and the process of review and testing, issue handling, etc\. can ensure stable and safe content output of the community\. Operators need to manage and maintain community content on a daily basis, deal with errors and matters and content that do not follow the process, and establish an automatic maintenance mechanism\. Valuable content should be promptly organized and aligned with the community\&\#39;s milestones and versioning plans to ensure effective version management\.

Good community governance enhances the engagement experience for users and developers alike, so that they can continue to contribute to the community, keep the complex system healthy, and make iterations of updates to more efficient\.

#### Open Source Security Governance Requires Long\-term Attention

Due to the open nature of source code, open\-source software is more susceptible to security vulnerabilities\. Moreover, as the use of software packages is widespread, some customers may not even be aware of the specific open\-source components included in the packages, further highlighting the issue of open\-source security\. In 2021, 81% of open\-source code repositories contained security vulnerabilities, with 49% of them classified as high\-risk vulnerabilities\. While there has been a slight decrease compared to 2020, historical data since 2016 consistently show a high rate of vulnerabilities in open\-source code repositories\.

The Log4j vulnerability incident at the end of 2021 affected nearly half of the global enterprises, highlighting the widespread impact of open\-source security issues\. While users need to take action on the implementation side to address security concerns, they also seek underlying security assurances from the supply side\. The emphasis on security and compliance by open\-source projects themselves can greatly avoid redundant efforts and enhance market trust\. Discovering security vulnerabilities can rely on the proactive actions of community developers or be facilitated through various activities and competitions\. Operators also need to utilize automated code scanning and other tools to promptly identify and address vulnerabilities related to code security and open\-source licenses\.

Moreover, it is crucial to establish a robust security governance framework that rigorously follows procedures throughout the entire process, including vulnerability testing, compliance testing, and issue resolution\. Only by ensuring proper security measures can open\-source software thrive and advance further on the path to commercialization\.

## Capital Market Situation for Open Source Projects

### Global Market Situation

#### 2022 Increasing Uncertainty in the International Metals Market, Early\-Stage Investment Fever

Since 2022, the global economic situation has continued to be filled with uncertainty\. Factors such as the ongoing COVID\-19 pandemic, the Russia\-Ukraine conflict, and high inflation in the European and American economies have led to significant market volatility\. The fluctuation in stock prices and substantial layoffs within North American technology companies have also cast a shadow over the future of the software market\.

However, despite such an environment, early\-stage investments in technology companies by European and American capital markets have not been heavily impacted\. According to statistics from The Wall Street Journal and PitchBook, venture capital funds raised a total of $151 billion in the first three quarters of 2022, surpassing the total annual funding amount of any previous year\. Even first\-time venture capital funds, which typically face financial challenges during economic downturns, performed well in terms of fundraising in 2022\. Looking at the data from the first three quarters, the fundraising performance of new market entrants in the venture capital space has maintained levels similar to those before 2021 and even shows signs of surpassing them\.

This strong fundraising performance has resulted in a historically high ammunition stockpile of nearly $300 billion\. Many limited partners \(LPs\), including family offices and sovereign funds, continue to support venture capital in the bearish market environment because they believe that the trend of technological developments such as AI is long\-term, while the current market uncertainty is short\-term\. Historical data also demonstrates that venture capital can generate higher returns compared to other assets during economic downturns\.

However, it should be noted that the downturn in the secondary market and the overall economic environment can still significantly impact the strategies and performance of technology venture capital\. Venture capital investors state that the underperformance of the secondary market has presented challenges for many portfolio companies in terms of their prospects for going public\. They expect that the valuations of some startups may remain relatively stagnant in the coming years, and the percentage of portfolio companies experiencing bankruptcy is expected to increase by approximately 10%\.

#### Rapid Growth of the Commercial Open\-Source Software Capital Market

The success of commercial open\-source software companies over the past 10\+ years is clear to all\. open source companies are gradually finding long\-term and stable commercialization paths, and a series of external factors \(such as the development of the public cloud, the increase in willingness to pay for enterprise services, etc\.\) have also contributed to the rapid development of commercial open source software products\.

According to OSS Capital, in 2013, only a handful \(\&lt;10\) of open\-source software companies had annual revenues of $110 million\. Over the past year, more than 40 open\-source software companies have reached this milestone threshold, and 10\+companies have successfully completed IPOs, including MongoDB, Elastic, GitLab, Conﬂuent, and other highly sought\-after companies in the second\-tier market\.

The market capitalization of open\-source software companies has also skyrocketed from about $10 billion 10 years ago to over $500 billion, with over $400 billion of that market value being achieved at the first level\. These are just the beginning stages of the open\-source software market, which OSS Capital and many VC investors believe has tremendous growth potential\.

<div class="callout">

**Expert Review**

**Jiang Tao**: Developer\-Led open\-source cloud\-native commercialization is growing rapidly, with annual revenue reaching $49 billion and growing at an annualized 20\+% growth rate\.

</div>

From January 2020 to September 2022, over 360 open\-source software companies raised over $24 billion in funding through 500\+ financing rounds on the global primary market\. More than 230 leading venture capital firms participated in the investment process of these open\-source software companies\.

During the 32\-month period from January 2020 to September 2022, there were 10 months where the funding amount exceeded $1 billion\. In February 2021, September 2021, and September 2022, the funding amount even surpassed $1\.5 billion\. As we entered the second half of 2022, with the continued deterioration of the international economic environment, investments from venture capital firms in open\-source software companies experienced a noticeable slowdown\. However, compared to the trend of a significant slowdown in secondary markets and VC investments in other primary markets since November of the previous year, the level of activity of open\-source software companies in the capital market has remained relatively resilient\.

From January 2020 to August 2022, over $24 billion in venture capital funds were invested globally in commercial open\-source software companies\.

#### VC Investors Focusing on the Open\-Source Software Market

The rapid development of the open\-source software market has attracted a significant number of VC investment firms to delve into this field\. Over the past few years, there has been an increase in investment firms focusing on investing in open\-source software companies\.

On one hand, as mentioned earlier, a large number of traditional VC funds have started to flow into this sector\. On the other hand, since around 2020, we have also seen the emergence of VCs that are more dedicated to investing in open\-source software companies\. One representative example is OSS Capital, founded in 2019, which exclusively invests in open\-source software projects\. Another example is Open Core Ventures \(OCV\), founded by GitLab Co\-founder and CEO Sid Sijbrandij in 2020\. Unlike traditional VCs, OCV actively seeks out promising open\-source projects that have not yet been commercialized, recruits entrepreneurs, and supplies funding and resources to incubate startup companies\.

Many traditional VC companies have also started to pay continuous attention to the open\-source software market\. In addition to the capital market report published by OSS Capital focusing on the open source software market, Runa Capital, a VC firm focused on B2B SaaS, Deep Tech, and Regulated Industry, began tracking the development speed of various open source projects on GitHub starting in October 2020 and released quarterly reports \(ROSS Index\) to announce the fastest\-growing open source software projects and their financing profiles during each period\. The U\.S\. VC firm Accel also published the Open100 list in September 2020, which highlighted 100 noteworthy commercial open\-source software companies across various industries\.

### Development of Open Source Software Commercialization in China

# Questionnaire



## Background of the Report

In early 2016, KAIYUANSHE released the \&\#34;2015 China Open Source Community Participation Survey Report\.\&\#34; In the following years, they continued to publish developer survey reports, aiming to present open\-source development in China from various perspectives\. This year, they embarked on this journey again, using data analysis and survey reports to create a map of China\&\#39;s open\-source world in 2022\. This questionnaire is an important part of the annual China Open Source Yearbook, as analysis reports without research are merely theoretical\. The questionnaire covers two aspects: personal information \(including work information and developer technical information\) and participation in open\-source communities\. Unlike previous years, this year, they have added topics related to open\-source community metrics and commercialization\. They welcome everyone to participate in the questionnaire and express their thoughts\. Through statistical surveys and analysis of approximately 30\-55 questions, they hope to depict the true current state of China\&\#39;s open source community, providing authoritative references for future open source successors\.

This questionnaire extensively investigates the open\-source participation of the respondents\. Within the respondents of this questionnaire, based on their level of involvement, open source participants are categorized as users, contributors, maintainers, and core contributors\. These roles form an onion model with progressively increasing levels\. The definitions for the four levels are as follows:

**Users:** **users **who have used one or more open\-source products\.

**Participants: **users who interact with the open source community \(e\.g\., participate in events organized by the open source community, attend community meetings, etc\.\)

**Contributors: **users who have made substantial contributions to the open\-source community \(including code and non\-code contributions\)

**Maintainers：** users who are primarily responsible for maintaining open source projects \(usually project maintainers, PMC members, etc\.\)

**The relationship between the four layers of  roles is shown in the figure：**

This survey primarily aims to investigate users, contributors, and maintainers in the open\-source community, as well as identify participants in open\-source projects\. The basic information of this survey is as follows:

**Survey Target:** Developers, community members, contributors, students, government, and enterprise managers\.

**Survey Method:** Online questionnaire to collect samples and data, analysis of data using cross\-comparison method\.
**Promotion Method:** Online social media, blogs, and open\-source community\.
Number of Questions: 55
**Question Types:** Multiple\-choice, single\-choice, open\-ended\.

**Sample Size**：392

**Completion Rate：**52\.48%

## Important Findings

Based on the analysis of the survey data, combined with a comparison to previous survey results and other publicly available statistical reports, we have made the following findings:

- In this survey, 106 respondents \(27%\) have not used open\-source products, while 286 respondents \(73%\) identify themselves as open\-source users\. Among the participants, 250 \(63%\) are open\-source contributors, and 143 \(36%\) are open\-source maintainers\.
